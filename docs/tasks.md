# Weather App Improvement Tasks

## Architecture and Code Organization

- [ ] SKIP Implement proper dependency injection instead of singletons for better testability (WeatherData,
  WeatherAlerts, AppwriteClient)
- [x] Separate UI logic from business logic in pages like home_page.dart and warnings_page.dart
- [x] Create a dedicated repository layer to abstract data sources from the UI
- [x] Standardize error handling across the application with a centralized error handling mechanism
- [ ] SKIP Implement a proper state management solution (e.g., Bloc or Riverpod) instead of mixing ChangeNotifier with
  ValueNotifier

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] SKIP Optimize map rendering in warnings_map_widget.dart to reduce memory usage
- [x] Implement more efficient caching strategy for weather data with time-based expiration
- [x] Reduce unnecessary rebuilds in the UI by using const constructors and more selective state updates
- [ ] SKIP Optimize XML parsing in weather_data.dart to handle large responses more efficiently
- [ ] SKIP Implement lazy loading for weather data when scrolling through forecast days
- [x] Add proper loading states and skeleton screens instead of simple progress indicators

## Code Quality and Maintainability

- [x] Add comprehensive documentation for all public methods and classes
- [x] Standardize naming conventions across the codebase (e.g., method naming in app_state.dart)
- [x] Remove debug print statements and implement proper logging system
- [x] Extract hardcoded strings to localization files (e.g., in weather_data.dart)
- [x] Refactor duplicate code in weather symbol mapping functions
- [x] Create dedicated models for API responses instead of working directly with parsed data

## Testing

- [x] Increase unit test coverage, especially for core business logic
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Implement widget tests for complex UI components
- [x] Create mocks for external dependencies to enable better testing
- [ ] Add automated UI tests for different screen sizes and orientations
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks to prevent regressions

## User Experience

- [x] Improve error messages and recovery options when network requests fail
- [x] Add pull-to-refresh functionality for weather data
- [ ] SKIP Implement better accessibility features (screen reader support, contrast modes)
- [ ] Add animations for weather transitions and loading states
- [ ] SKIP Improve responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] SKIP Implement offline mode with cached data

## Feature Enhancements

- [ ] SKIP Implement weather notifications for severe weather alerts
- [x] Refactor large widget classes (like in home_page.dart) into smaller, more focused components
- [ ] SKIP Add historical weather data visualization
- [ ] SKIP Improve location search with recent searches and better suggestions
- [ ] SKIP Add more detailed wind information (wind rose, gusts over time)
- [ ] SKIP Implement sharing functionality for weather forecasts

## Security and Privacy

- [ ] Add privacy policy and terms of service

## Build and Deployment

- [ ] SKIP Optimize app size by reducing dependencies and assets
- [ ] Add crash reporting and analytics
