## Overview

The Weather App is a Flutter application that provides weather forecasts, observations, and alerts for user-selected
locations. It features a responsive design, multiple data sources, and cross-device synchronization.

### Key Features

- **Weather Forecasts**: Hourly and daily forecasts with detailed weather information
- **Weather Observations**: Historical temperature and wind data for supported locations
- **Weather Alerts**: Warnings and alerts for severe weather conditions
- **Location Management**: Save and manage favorite locations
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Synchronize favorite locations across devices using AppWrite
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Uses OpenMeteo for global forecasts and Harmonie for Nordic/Baltic countries

## Getting Started

To understand the app's architecture and implementation:

1. Start with the [Data Models](data_models.md) documentation to understand the core data structures
2. Review the [Widget Trees](widget_trees.md) to understand the UI structure
3. Explore the [App State Management](app_state.md) to understand how state is managed
4. Learn about the [AppWrite Integration](appwrite_integration.md) for cloud features

## Development Guidelines

When working on the Weather App, follow these guidelines:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI, business logic, and data access separate
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all UI components adapt to different screen sizes
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation when making significant changes
5. **Testing**: Write tests for new features and bug fixes
6. **Performance**: Consider performance implications, especially for network operations

## Future Improvements
